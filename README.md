## Youtube Video Page Clone

This is our first Microverse project ever, part of the HTML and CSS course!!

In this project our goal was to replicate the page of a video in YouTube. We chosed a random video and replicated as close as possible to the actual page.

## Tools

We used stylelint to clean the code and look for errors.
